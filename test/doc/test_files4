Purpose
Tests file management syscalls, such as creat(), open(), read(), write(), close(), unlink(). 

File descriptor management and critical implementation requirements are also tested. 

For example, the following requirement in specification is tested: if any processes still have the file open, the file will remain in existence until the last file descriptor referring to it is closed. 

However, creat() and open() will not be able to return new file descriptors for the file until it is deleted.

Usage:
-- nachos.ag.CoffGrader -x test_files4.coff

Note:
Logs are written to filetest.log
